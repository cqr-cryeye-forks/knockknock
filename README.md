KnockKnock runs a simple reverse whois lookup which returns a list of domains owned by people or companies.

This tool is often used for reconnaissance or OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) purposes.

Please note that the results can also contain domains that are not owned by the particular target, whereas the target represents a whois guard.

### Installation
`go get -v github.com/harleo/knockknock`
